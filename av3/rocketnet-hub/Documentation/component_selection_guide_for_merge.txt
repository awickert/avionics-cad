Component Selection Guide
---
This page aims to explain the reasoning behind the selection of each component used in the power and communications hub designed by the 2012-13 capstone team. The intention is to provide insight into the design decisions made however there is no intention to provide the reader with a comprehensive design example that is suitable for any purpose other than exact replication. The target audience is expected to have design experience with microelectronics power distribution and modern physical layer communications designs utilizing matched impedance differential signaling.

U1, MCU, ST Microelectronics STM32F407V100
---
For this project the MCU chosen was to not only to be used for our capstone design but also migrated to replace the MCU used on the Generic Front Ends (GFEs). Thus despite a push from the capstone team to use an Atmel AV32 or Atmel ARM MCU it was decided by PSAS that an ST Micro STM32F407 MCU would be used. This microcontroller does offer some cost advantages over Atmel's offerings both in per unit cost and the cost of development tools. Given that PSAS is a cost conscious group that has ample expertise to draw from, the higher quality documentation offered by Atmel did not justify the added expense. Several Olimex STM32-E407 development boards where acquired and used by the PSAS software team to concurrently develop firmware for the RocketNet-Hub.

* Support Components:

 * Crystal (C106, C107, and X1 -- 8Y-25.000MEEQ-T)

    The MCU has an internal oscillator circuit and can run without an external crystal. However, for Ethernet functionality the MII interface must operate at 25MHz +/- 50ppm. This is beyond the capabilities of the internal oscillator. Thus an external crystal must be used. The value that makes the most sense to the design team is 25MHz. By using this value we can avoid mucking around with the PLL resources of the MCU and still provide the required MII interface clock. Additionally, the MCU has two clock outputs and we can use one of these to buffer the crystal and use this same crystal to also drive the KS8999 Ethernet switch. The part selected is the 8Y-25.000MEEQ-T from TXC Corp. This crystal has a load capacitance rating of 10pF and a +/-10ppm frequency stability/tolerance. The load capacitors should be selected with 1% or less tolerance and C0G temp. coefficient or better.

 * Bypass Caps 

    The supply pins of the MCU will each be provisioned one 0.1uF ceramic cap. X5R or X7R 0402 ceramic capacitors should be used. A bulk capacitor with a nominal value of between 10 and 22 uF should be placed near the MCU's 0.1uF bypass caps. The bulk capacitance value is not critical so any temp. coef. 0603 ceramic cap will work. The two crystal pins also require capacitors. For these two C0G ceramic 0402 capacitors should be used. The value should be 10pF.

 * Analog Supply Filtering (E5)

    The Analog supply pins were isolated with an 0603 ferrite bead to block digital switching noise. As the only analog resource used in the MCU was the ADC to monitor the current draws of both the battery and each node, this was likely an overly conservative addition to the board. During testing it is recommended that the ferrite bead be replaced with a 0 Ohm resistor. This will allow for a reduced BOM for future revisions of the board should it prove functional without this filter.

* Interfaces

 * Reset Logic

    The MCU has a reset signal that needs to be weakly pulled high during normal operation. This is accomplished by a 10kOhm resistor. The value is chosen to reduce power consumption when the line is pulled low. (Though given the length of time that this signal is ever likely to be held low it is a really rather pointless consideration. Any value from 100 to 100k could be used.) The MCU has internal power on reset and brownout detection circuitry and thus no external reset logic was added to ensure proper response to these conditions.

 * JTAG (J22)

    The MCU supports both programming and debugging through the ARM standard JTAG interface. This bus is broken out to a 2x5 50mil header. Signals used are the TMS, TCK, TDO, TDI, and MCU reset. For more information on these signals or the JTAG implementation used in the STM32F407 please see google.com

 * Serial UART (J10)

    To support realtime debugging and logging, a serial UART channel was broken out to a 1x4 50mil header. Signals preset are TXD and RXD, no flow control signals are present. This is a 3.3V interface with no protection. Care should be used to ensure that the USB to UART adapter used is configured for 3.3V or damage will likely result to the MCU, adapter, or both.

 * MII

    The MCU is connected to the Ethernet switch, discussed later, by two interfaces. The MII interface is the connection between the MAC and switch. The other interface is a serial interface and will be discussed below. The MII interface is an industry standard interface for connecting a MAC to a PHY. It is implemented per the standard with the exception that neither TX\_ERR or RX\_ERR are present. More information on this interface can be found via Goolge.com.

 * I2C (J11, R15, R17)

    The I2C, or more properly TWI, interface is used to interface with the battery charger IC and fuel gauge IC. The MCU is the bus master. This is an open collector interface and thus requires the presence of a pull up resistor on each signal line. 2.2kOhm 0403 resistors were selected from past experience--no calculations or simulations were performed. If the bus fails at desired baud, please scope the bus at J? and look for excessive skew. If this is found, decrease the value of the pull ups. If reduction in power consumption is desired, these may be increased until such point as the bus begins to fail at max baud.

 * Rocket\_RDY (Q1, U3)

The MCU is responsible for sending the final go signal to the launch tower signifying that the rocket is ready to launch. This is accomplished through a non-inverted signal buffered by a simple N-channel MOSFET. The signal is pulled high on the gate side and low on the source side. It is isolated from the MCU by the FET and protected by a 100Ohm resistor and parallel TVS diodes. The Capstone team wished to implement this signal differentially due to the 9m long cable that it must be sent over, but the cable had already been assembled. Future revisions of this board and the Launch Tower interface should explore further the benefits of differential signaling.

* Debugging

 * RBG LED (LED37)

    A single RGB LED was added to facilitate simple state display of the MCU. The implementation of the state machine and assignment of colors is left to the firmware team.

 * Serial UART (J10)

    A serial UART port is provided to facilitate realtime logging via print statements. The implementation of this functionality is left to the firmware team. Using the boot mode selection headers it is also possible to load a boot image over the UART port without flashing the internal memory. This can be used during initial code bring up to reduce time wasted writing images to flash. 

 * JTAG (J22)

    The STM32F407 supports JTAG programming and debugging. This is useful for stepping through code but is not appropriate for realtime debugging. This bus is intended only for initial programming and code bring-up.

 * BOOT SEL (J5, J12)

    The STM32F407 supports multiple boot sources and this can be selected by pulling the BOOT\_SEL pins either high or low. In conjunction with the UART port it is possible to load a boot image directly from a host computer without flashing the internal memory. This can be useful for initial code bringup. Please see the datasheet for boot configurations.

* System Monitoring

 * Current Draw (U14, U15)

    The MCU is configured to monitor the current draw of each connected node and the battery. This is accomplished through the internal ADC and two external analog multiplexers. At any time the MCU is monitoring one node from NODE\_1 through NODE\_4 and one node from NODE\_6 through NODE\_8, the only exception to the previous statement is that when monitoring NODE\_1, it is the only node monitored as there is no NODE\_5. The node currents are measured on NODE1\_4\_IMON and NODE5\_8\_IMON. Selection of the nodes to monitor is accomplished by setting the select bits IMON\_A0 and IMON\_A1. The battery's charge current is also monitored. This is present on BAT\_IMON. Use of this data is left to the firmware team, though possible uses would be to shut down a node if it is drawing unusually high or low amounts of current or determining if there is enough current sourcing capacity to turn on a given sub-system.

* System Control

 * Ethernet Switch (C12, D1, Q8, Q9, R43, R65)

    The MCU is responsible for enabling the Ethernet switch. This is done by asserting ETH\_EN. This will enable the switch's 2.1V LDO and access to 3.3V IO supply. Once both supplies stabilize, the MCU must boot strap the Ethernet switch using the SPI3 serial interface. This is a hack. The switch is designed to function as an I2C slave on a dedicated bus but the MCU only has a single I2C interface and that bus has other devices on it. The proper solution would have been to use a bi-directional tri-statable logic buffer to isolate the Ethernet switch from the rest of the I2C bus. However, the decision came down from PSAS to use the SPI interface. Implementation is left to the firmware team. The Ethernet switch can be reset without powering down its supplies by clearing ETH\_RST\_N. Note: this signal should not be tri-stated and driven to a known state prior to asserting ETH\_EN. Please note that C12 and R43 create a delay in ramping the 3.3V supply to allow the 2.1V core supply to come up first. D1 ensures that this supply is shut off quickly.


 * Node Power

    Each node can be turned on or off by the MCU. This is accomplished by clearing or setting (respectively) the NODEx\_!EN signal. In the case that a node draws more current than it is intended to and triggers the over-current protection system, the NODEx\_!FLT signal will be asserted. It is left to the firmware team to determine proper response to this signal.

U4, Ethernet Switch, Micrel KSZ8999
---
The design requirements dictated that the switch chosen must have at least 7 ports. Furthermore, we were restricted from using any Broadcom SoC due to the company's exclusive access model. This left us with only Micrel's offerings to work with. The KS8999 had the added benefit of an MII interface to the MCU which allowed the design to avoid adding any discrete PHY IC's. It also met the design requirements by offering 8 ports with integrated PHYs and one MII digital interface. The Micrel KS8999 development board was acquired to test potential configurations so that these settings could be set on the first run of the PCB. The settings used are:

* MIIS: 2b'X1 (reverse MII mode)
* MODESEL: 4b'0000 (LED mode 0)
* CFGMODE:1b'0 (I2C Bootstrap)
* LED[8][3]:1b'0 (AutoMDIX)
* Supporting Components

 * Voltage Supplies (C12, D1, Q8, Q9, R43, R65, U6)

    The KS8999 required a 2.1(V) core and analog IO voltage. This is not a voltage that would otherwise have been provided on the board and thus an LDO was selected to do so. Please see Power Supplies for additional design decisions related to this LDO. There IO logic requires 3.3V to match the digital IO on the MCU. The 3.3V must ramp after the 2.1V supply. To accomplish this, a RC delay circuit and PMOS power switch was implemented. The diode (D1) allows for this to be shut down without waiting for the RC delay circuit to discharge.

 * Bypass Caps

    The supply pins of the KS8999 will each be provisioned one 0.1uF ceramic cap. X5R or X7R 0402 ceramic capacitors should be used. Bulk capacitors with a nominal value of  10uF should be placed near the KS8999's 0.1uF bypass caps. The bulk capacitance value is not critical so any temp. coef. 0603 ceramic cap will work. 

 * Pull Up/Down Resistors (R2, R3, R4, R6, R7, R8, R10, R13, R14, R72, R116, R117, R118, R119, R120)

Several of the pins on the KS8999 must be pulled to either Vdd or GND to place the IC in normal operating mode. This is accomplished with 0402 0 Ohm resistors. The interested reader should consult the datasheet for further information on the effect of these pull downs. R72 is present as the MCU MAC's interface does not provision a TX\_ERR signal and thus it is tied low on the PHY side.

 * Reset Circuitry (D2, D3)

    The KS8999's reset is not 3.3(V) tolerant and thus diodes and pull up resistors must be used to ensure safe operation. The circuit is provided in the data sheet. 0402 10k resistors should be used to minimize power dissipation. Any tolerance value may be selected. The diodes are SOT-23 to minimize size. The forward voltage should be minimized to ensure the reset line can be pulled low enough to be read as a logic 0. Schottky diodes are optimal for this purpose. The CDBQR0130L from Comchip Tech was selected for this purpose.

 * Signal LEDs (LED1, LED5, LED9, LED13, LED17, LED21, LED25, LED29, LED33)

    Each port provisions up to four signaling LEDs to denote the current state of the port. 0402 LEDs will be used with a nominal ID of 1mA. As each node will have two power indicators, green for power good and red to indicate a fault condition, yellow/amber seems the most reasonable choice for the Ethernet status indicators. PSAS determined that only one status LED per port needed to be placed. The part number selected for this component is VLMY1500-GS08 from Vishay. Forward voltage is 2V.

 * Magnetics (Chokes: L2, L3, L4, L5, L6, L7, L8, L9, L10, L11, L12, L13, L14, L15, L16, L17 and transformers: T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T10, T11, T12, T13, T14, T15, T16, T17, T18)

The physical layer of the Ethernet specification (for copper) requires that the PHY's on either side of the connection be AC coupled to each other. To accomplish this purpose build magnetic transformers from Pulse were selected by PSAS and tested on the dev board. Additionally, common-mode chokes were also added to improve signal integrity. The transformers are quite large components and much effort was put into attempting to use capacitors to AC couple the connection and save space. This proved fruitless and transformers were selected instead. The exact reason for failing to successfully couple with capacitors is unknown and further research for future revisions of the board should be considered.

U7, U8, U9, U10, U11, U12, U13, Node Power Switches, TPS2420
---
Each of the 7 nodes to be connected to this distribution board was to have its own power switch controlled by the MCU. After much debate the TPS2420 from TI was selected. This IC offered the design team many benefits though it also provided unnecessary functionality. Our main requirements for the node power switch were that it provides a high level of integration with no external components except small capacitors and resistors. An integrated FET was a must. Over current protection was also a must. The TPS2420 was selected by PSAS from TI's offering of hotswap power switches by PSAS. The justification was that it also included a soft current limit that could be exceeded for a limited time and the ability to externally set its reset behavior. The package size was also of utmost consideration. The TPS2420 comes in a standard QFN-16 with a DAP to dissipate heat. Key settings for this chip are:

* Hard Current Limit (IMAX) (R51, R66, R67, R68, R69, R70, R71):
 
 Set by node--Set resistor on top side of IC
* Soft Current Limit (IFLT) (R121, R122, R123, R124, R125, R126, R127):

 Set by node--Set resistor on top side of IC
* Soft Limit Timer (CT) (C95, C96, C97, C98, C99, C100, C101):

 Set by node--Set Capacitor on top side of IC
* Reset Behavior:

 Latch reset condition and wait for MCU to reset switch

Additionally, LED's were connected to the power good and fault signal lines, green and red respectively. These lines are common collector and thus pulled high by 10kOhm shunt resistors. The TPS2420's final benefit is a scaled version of the output current that is clamped to 2.5(V). This is used to drive an ADC channel on the MCU via an analog mux.

* IMON Resistor (R49, R52, R54, R56, R58, R60, R62): TBD
* Power Good LED (LED3, LED6, LED8, LED11, LED14, LED16, LED39): APT1608CGCK (Green 0603 V\_f 2.1V I\_d 20mA)
* Fault Cond. LED (LED2, LED4, LED7, LED10, LED12, LED15, LED18): APT1608EC (Red 0603 V\_f 2V I\_d 20mA)
* LED Current Limiting Resistors (R19, R23, R26, R30, R33, R36, R39, R50, R53, R57, R63, R107, R110, R112): 750 Ohm (1.6 mA - 1.73 mA)

U5, U6, Power Supplies, LTM8023, MIC37101
---
The board is powered by a 4-cell LiPo battery pack. This works out to a nominal voltage of just under 15(V) under battery power and under charging conditions the nominal voltage is 18(V). These voltages are far too high to run modern logic on. Also the potential swing in voltage is too large. The MCU can run on 1.8(V)-3.3(V). The design was intended to run on 3.3(V) initially. This became slightly more complicated after the selection of the KS8999 Ethernet Switch as this chip requires a 2.1(V) core voltage. The LTM8023 uModule from Linear Technologies was selected for its high level of integration and low external part count. The LTM8023 is capable of sourcing up to 2(A) of regulated power with an efficiency of 80%+. As the KS8999 requires 1(A) just by itself the 2(A) 3.3(V) supply seemed reasonable to source its LDO and the remaining logic. The Micrel MIC37101 line of LDO's was selected to source power to the KS8999. The MIC37101-2.1YM is a fixed voltage LDO with a typical output rating 1.6(A). This is sufficient to drive the KS8999 with reasonable headroom to account for potential variation. All resistors chosen came from each manufacturer's datasheet (with the exception of the LED current limiting resistor R128). The external components for the LMT8023 were provided by the manufacturer datasheet. The capacitors chosen for the Micrel MIC37101 were the minimum value recommended in the datasheet necessary to ensure stability.

* LTM8023 Settings:
 * Vout: 3.3(V)
 * Osc. Freq.: 650KHz
 * Sync. Freq.: 650KHz -- set by MCU pll
 * R\_T (R74): 49.9KOhm
 * R\_ADJ (R73): 154KOhm
 * C\_in (C103): 2.2uF (0805)
 * C\_out (C104): 22uF (1206)
 * PGOOD LED (LED22): APT1608CGCK (Green 0603 V\_f 2.1V I\_d 20mA)
 * LED Current Limiting Resistor (R128): 750 Ohm (1.6 mA)
 * EN: Tied to supply voltage, Always on

* MIC37101-2.1YM Settings:
 * EN: Weakly pulled to logic 0, controlled by MCU.ETH_EN
 * C\_in (C52): 47uF
 * C\_out (C84, C85): 4.7uF, 0.1uF

U14, U15, Analog Multiplexers, MAX4734
---
The STM32F407V LQFP-100 lacks sufficient ADC inputs to simultaneously monitor the output current of all the nodes and the battery charger. The solution to this limitation was to either move to a larger package of the STM32F407 or add one or more analog muxes. The mux solution simplified routing and allowed for all the GFEs to use the same chip and package as the used for the distribution board. The specific mux chosen, Maxim's MAX4734, was selected for its small size (QFN-9) and very low Ron. The choice to use 2 4:1 muxes instead of one 8:1 mux was made to further simplify layout. The select bits for the muxes are shared meaning that at any given time the MCU is monitoring the charge current and two node currents, the only exception is IMON\_Ax = 2'b00 when only Node 1 is monitored as there is no Node 5. To simplify the firmware team's job slightly, a pull down was added to N1 of U15 to ensure that the value reported for the non-existent Node 5 is always in a known state.

* Bypass Capacitors (C10, C11):
 * Standard IC bypass caps, 100nF
 * Pull-down Resistors (R18):
 * To account for the odd number of channels being multiplexed by the two MAX4734's one input of U15 is pulled low to provide a known value for that channel.

U2, Battery Charger, BQ24725
---
The onboard battery charger had been selected by PSAS prior to the beginning of the capstone project and was presented to the capstone team as a black box solution. Integration of the dev board's circuit with minimal adjustment was requested. The interested reader is directed to the datasheet and dev board user's guide for more information on this sub system. Connections to the black box are I2C(<->), BAT\_IMON(->), external DC power(<-), Battery power(<-), and +18V(->). All internal signals are replicated per the dev board. Most components selected are per the dev board's BOM.

* In-Rush Limiter (R11, C60):

 The two 3.9 Ohm 0.5W resistors from the evaluation board were replaced with a single 2 Ohm 1 W resistor. The 2512 size was selected because it was the smallest available component.
* Transient Voltage Suppression (D5):

 A reverse biased TVS diode (SMAJ18CA) was added to protect against over-voltage. 20V voltage breakdown was chosen for the diode based on +18V Vin shore power.
* Enable (EN) Circuitry

 Removed the optional enable/disable circuitry on VCC which causes board to be always-on when plugged into a power source.
* Various Capacitors:

 Sizes determined by component availability of 40V caps:
>10uF 1206; =2.2uF 0805; >1uF(<2.2uF) 0603; <1uF 0402
* Reverse Input Voltage Protection (Q6, R132, R133):
 
 These components provide system and IC protection from reversed shore power (Vin) voltage. In normal operation, Q6 is turned off by negative Vgs. If the adapter voltage is reversed, Q6 Vgs is positive. As a result, Q6 turns on to short gate and source of Q2 so that Q2 is off. The Q2 body diode in reverse biased orientation blocks negative voltage from traversing into the system. However, CMSRC and ACDRV pins need R10 and R11 to limit the current due to the ESD diode of these pins when turned on. Q6 has a low Vgs threshold voltage and low Qgs gate charge so it turns on before Q2 turns on. R10 and R11 must have enough power rating for the power dissipation when the ESD diode is on, again these were selected based on the datasheet.
* Negative Output (BAT) Voltage Protection (R144, R143):

 If the battery pack is inserted backwards into the charger output (BAT) during production or there is a hard short on the battery to ground, it will generate a negative output voltage on the SRP and SRN pins. Built in IC internal electrostatic-discharge (ESD) diodes from GND pin to SRP or SRN pins and two anti-parallel (AP) diodes between SRP and SRN pins can be forward biased and negative current can pass through the ESD diodes and AP diodes when output has negative voltage. These two resistors for SRP and SRN pins are inserted to limit the negative current level when output (BAT) has negative voltage. The recommended resistor values of 10 Ohm (R144) for SRP pin and 7.5 Ohm (R143) for SRN pin were used.
* Inductor (L1):

 The BQ24725 has three selectable fixed switching frequencies, the higher switching frequency allows the use of smaller inductor and capacitor values. The BQ24725 has charge under current protection (UCP) by monitoring charging current sensing resistor (R134) cycle-by-cycle.
* Input (C39, C43) and Output (C119, C120) Capacitors
* Power MOSFETs (Q2, Q3, Q5)
