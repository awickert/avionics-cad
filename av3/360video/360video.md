Using H11F1 opto-isolator FET chip between APS "RC" output and GoPros "start" line. The FET grounds out the "start" line, and they all turn on and start recording.

We tested this system on the Agilent power supplies, and a forward curent I_f = 1 mA turned them on no problem.

The APS will run the H11F1 at 3.3V, Vf = 1.2 V so R = 2.1V/3mA = 700 ohms, so call it 750 ohms = 2.8 mA ish.
