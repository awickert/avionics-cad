# CAD Models for RocketBus Connector

Bare connectors tend to fall off rockets, so we have 3D printed plastic parts to accept bolts and lock down our cables.

## FreeCAD

Documents are made in [FreeCAD](http://free-cad.sourceforge.net/).

Files with `.part.` in the name are drawings of just a particular solid part.

`rockebus.assem.fcstd` is the full assembly with conncetors, bolts and boards all modeled. Printable parts can be exported by highlighting them and choosing File > export.

Version 0.2 printed at the [Electronics Prototyping Lab](http://psu-epl.github.com/) at PSU.
