ADIS16405 IMU adapter boards

## "imu-adapter" - Adapt ADIS to node5 GFE

This board adapts the ADIS to the node5 (LPC2468 USB-based generic board). It was built, and worked.


## "imu-adapter-e407" - Adapt ADIS to Olimex STM32-E407 dev board

This board adapts the ADIS to the Olimex STM32-E407 (STM32F407 w/Ethernet) development board. It is a 1/16" single-sided PCB that must be mounted to the same mounting plane that the ADIS is mounted to. In the PCB, the holes for the ADIS and the ADIS connector are precisely spaced (see Analog Devices AN-1045 and ADIS datasheet for dimensions).

WARNING: Test points are on both sides of board, so if the board is against metal, make sure it's truly single-sided PCB.
