This board is AV3's "sensor" sheild for an Olimex STM32-E407 development board. 

It connects the E407 board to:

- Analog Devices ADIS16405BMLZ 6DOF IMU with magnetometer (SPI)
- Invensense MPU-9150  6DOF IMU with magnetometer (I2C)
- Freescale MPL3115A2 pressure sensor (I2C)

It also brings up the Vin connection and the the ethernet jack pins in order to replace the 
coaxial jack and the ethernet jack with a RocketNet connector.

This daughter board requires the removal of the Ethernet, coaxial, and all "jumper" pin headers 
in order to fit.

- Nothing yet!
