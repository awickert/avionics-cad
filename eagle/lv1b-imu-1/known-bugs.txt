Known Bugs for LV1B imu-analog board v.1

imu main board trim cap does not connect to gyro amp A+ as it should
 ( 1 places, C402, backside)

Reference for ADXL202 circuit should be Vref, not Gnd.

Via got deleted for signal Theta Out on main board at daughter board connection

1uF cap does not clear PX sensor on backside, also 1uF cap seems spurious,
 why not throw in a 10uF? Whatever.

The 820uF inductor in the negative supply line creates a ground loop by raising
the analog board ground to ~0.45 Volts relative to the digital board. This can
be handled by removing the inductor, but shorting the ground planes doesn't
reduce the current consumption by more than 0.1mA, so removal may actually not
be warranted (but probably is). In future, however, i'd like to handle this
differently. The battery lines should be filtered, and the digital and analog
boards should have their true grounds heavily tied. This means circuits
switching the battery negative need to deal w/potentials below ground, but
though this is probably added complexity, it is required for reliability anyway.
Further, this arrangement should have significant noise advantages.

Daughter board signal ZO should not pass through on main board
(In fact all the daughter board connection on the main board should be checked
 and extended only to the traces they contact, and not to any perforating holes.)

Offset in J1 relative to flight computer (perhaps adjust FC?)
--Fixed by modifying FC

Added a 1nF feedfwd cap across voltage divider (maybe should be 1uF?)
Added boot-strap resistor from 5V to 6.025V supply (10k)
 Changed this resistor to a diode, which is both stiffer on start, making
 startup independent of load, and open after startup, saving power.
