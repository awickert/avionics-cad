PSAS EAGLE Library Notes.

2004/07/24

We really dislike the way that EAGLE handles libraries and parts. To deal with this, we've created our own libraries which have some naming rules. IN particular, each device that you add should start with the device prefix. For example,

CONN_
RES_
CAP_
IC_

..etc. Please try and stick to this as closely as possible. It'll make finding parts in the future so much more easy.
